##  Overview

The Node_js_projects codebase comprises distinct modules, each serving a unique purpose. The store API module facilitates robust data management by populating MongoDB with product details and ensuring seamless API connections, error handling, and data retrieval. On the other hand, the job API module focuses on job-related operations, offering authentication, user authorization, and CRUD functionalities. Lastly, the task manager module streamlines task management activities, providing an intuitive UI for task submission, editing, and deletion. These modules collectively enhance the Node_js_projects repository's value proposition by promoting efficient data handling, secure user interactions, and streamlined task management within a cohesive ecosystem.
